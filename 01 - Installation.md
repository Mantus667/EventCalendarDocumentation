# Installation

It is possible to install the package through Nuget or as an Umbraco package.

Type: `install-package EventCalendar.Umbraco` in your Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager.

If you just want to work with the api then also have a look at the core library:

Type: `install-package EventCalendar.Core` in your Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager.
